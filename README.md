The following files were the ones that we had modified to support the simplification algorithm:

1.Sandbox.cpp / Sandbox.h

2.inputManager.cpp

3.Viewer.cpp /Viewer.h - added a vitual function that is called initData in order to support simplification for loaded objects

4.ImGuiMenu - added the command viewer->initData() to the function that handles loading objects.

in order to run the project:
---
1.clone the git repository

2.Run Cmake gui. choose the project folder and destination folder for the cpp project files.

3.Search for "texture_image"on viewerdata.cpp and replace "snake1" with the correct path of your directory.

4.Confirm correct configurations paths.

5.Copy configuration.txt from tutorial/sandBox to build/tutorial/sandBox sandBox as a startup project and compile the project (it could take few minutes);

6.Build the project
